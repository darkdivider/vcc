This is an experimental server set up for testin load balancing algorithms

In Linux environment run commands

"service docker start"
"docker-compose up --build"

Once docker is up and running, run "python gen_arg.py" . This generates the file "arguments.txt"
Run " python main.py" This generates the file "results.txt" which gives the results of the experiment.

The test is done for 3 types of requesting scheme:
 - 'f': Flood requesting by generating requests at max frequency
 - 'r': Random delay from 0 to 100 ms and parallel requesting
 - 's': Sequential requesting. Next request made only upon recieving previous response

4 types of load balancing are done:
 - 'rn': App selected at random
 - 'rr': App selected in round robin fashion (whether free or not)
 - 'ls': Least mean response time
 - 'lt': Least last response time

Upto 10000 requests are made.

Upto 7 apps are used.

All the apps are identical
