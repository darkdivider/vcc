This is an experimental server set up for testin laod balancing algorithms

In Linux environment run commands

"service docker start"
"docker-compose up --build"

Once docker is up and running, run 

"python gen_requests.py"

with the following arguments

positional arguments:
  n                     Number of requests

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --method {rn,rr,ls,lt}, -m {rn,rr,ls,lt}
                        Balancing method(rn:random, rb:roundrobin, ls: least mean, lt: last)
  --apps {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, -a {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
                        Number of server apps running

This runs requests and prints 
response time per request
cycle time in seconds per request
overheads for load balancing in seconds per request
